## Guidelines
### Points (Personal Scoring, out of 10)
| Multipliers | Difficulty |
| -------- | ------- |
| x5 | Hard 🔴 |
| x3 | Medium 🟡 |
| x1 | Easy 🟢 |

| Points | Reason |
| -------- | ------- |
| +2 | BONUS ✨: Under 20 minutes |
| 10 | First Try (Correct + Optimal) |
| 7 | First Try (Correct) |
| 4 | Multiple Tries/Redo (Correct) |
| 3 | Justifiable Logic for Correct Answer, but Unfinished Code |
| 2 | Broad Sense of Solution, but Cannot Translate to Code |
| 1 | Completely Off The Solution/No Justification for Logic |


<strong>Clarifications/Notes</strong>: 
<ul>
<li>A "Try" is a session of MAX 30 minutes. After that, the max is only 4 points.</li>
<li>You may REDO any problem, but only for 4 points. However, the REDO is still eligible for a BONUS of +2 (maximum of 6 points total for the REDO). Recommended only after at least a week since your last attempt. </li>
<li>"Optimal" refers to the best possible time and space complexity available for the solution (going off of NeetCode/Solutions Tab).</li>
<li>Remember to utilize the difficulty multiplier! You may be losing out on some well-deserved points! </li>
 <li>Being eligble for 2 points means that you should have a logically sound explanation (approved by the others), so make sure to mark it!</li>
</ul>

Commit Message: # of Points with Difficulty <br/>
 
`Add (Brief) Explanations and Analyze Complexities (TC, SC)`

ex: \
 '''\
 TLDR: Use hashmap. Have a for loop to fill the hashmap, then use another loop to check if there is a difference in the hashmap.

 TC O(n)\
 SC O(n)\
